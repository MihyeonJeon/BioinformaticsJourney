In particular, the World Banks has records of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by country from 1960-2015.   The World Bank site includes lots of tools for visually analyzing this GDP data. This [page](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)  at the World Bank data site allows users to plot the yearly GDP of a particular country in terms of current US dollars.\n","\n"," The raw economic data collected by the World Bank is freely available for download and analysis.  In particular, the yearly data on GDP in current US dollars is available as a CSV file. We have downloaded a version of the CSV file which contains GDP data up until the end of 2015 and slightly updated this file to handle missing GDP data in a more consistent manner.  Our version of the the CSV file is available [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/codeskulptor-isp/course4/isp_gdp.csv).  Please use this version for your project since having everyone work from the same data set will make testing your code much easier."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"P05PW2tVIAP_"},"source":["PATH = '/content/drive/MyDrive/etc/isp_gdp_csv_files/'"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"StxAV0HuOenD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1627628637642,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":4701,"user":{"displayName":"Mihyeon Jeon","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjQBbAoBwgaTXP4kXplvHFk_u2CWfrbWbMTKf-2gA=s64","userId":"09889641946361201246"}},"outputId":"8b5cb0e6-6b47-4577-9774-12f22185f34f"},"source":["!pip install pygal"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting pygal\n","  Downloading pygal-2.4.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (127 kB)\n","\u001b[?25l\r\u001b[K     |██▋                             | 10 kB 24.0 MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |█████▏                          | 20 kB 29.4 MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |███████▊                        | 30 kB 12.9 MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |██████████▎                     | 40 kB 9.5 MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |████████████▉                   | 51 kB 5.3 MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |███████████████▍                | 61 kB 5.9 MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |██████████████████              | 71 kB 5.6 MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |████████████████████▌           | 81 kB 6.2 MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |███████████████████████▏        | 92 kB 6.4 MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |█████████████████████████▊      | 102 kB 5.1 MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████▎   | 112 kB 5.1 MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |██████████████████████████████▉ | 122 kB 5.1 MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 127 kB 5.1 MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: pygal\n","Successfully installed pygal-2.4.0\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"sueqqw-RCXVx"},"source":["\"\"\"\n","Project for Week 2 of \"Python Data Visualization\".\n","Read World Bank GDP data and create some basic XY plots.\n","\n","Be sure to read the project description page for further information\n","about the expected behavior of the program.\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","import csv\n","import pygal\n","\n","\n","def read_csv_as_nested_dict(filename, keyfield, separator, quote):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Inputs:\n","      filename  - Name of CSV file\n","      keyfield  - Field to use as key for rows\n","      separator - Character that separates fields\n","      quote     - Character used to optionally quote fields\n","\n","    Output:\n","      Returns a dictionary of dictionaries where the outer dictionary\n","      maps the value in the key_field to the corresponding row in the\n","      CSV file.
