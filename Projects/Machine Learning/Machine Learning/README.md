# Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction Model
This project was a team project from the Machine Learning course in VU Amsterdam, especially in a master's Bioinformatics and Systems Biology.
My role was data preprocessing and feature selection based on data analysis.

## Objective
This project aims to improve the accuracy of protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction using a combination of machine learning
 models. Since the dataset had more than a hundred of features, the main focus was on preprocessing with R to ensure data quality and efficiancy in modeling.

## This project utilizes several R libraries to perform data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization:

- `dplyr`: Used for data manipulation and transformation.
- `faux`: Employed for generating simulated datasets (if applicable).
- `DataExplorer`: Utilized for automatic data exploration which speeds up the initial data understanding process.
- `caret`: Provides a suite of tools for creating predictive models and performing cross-validation.
- `randomForest`: Used to fit random forest models for classification or regression tasks.
- `ggplot2`: Applied for creating various aesthetic data visualizations.
- `corrplot`: Used for generating correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables.
- `MASS`: Employed for its statistical tools and data sets which are used in several data analysis techniques.
