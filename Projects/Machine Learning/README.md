# Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction Model
This project was a team project from the Machine Learning course in VU Amsterdam, especially in a master's Bioinformatics and Systems Biology.
My role in this project was data preprocessing and feature selection based on data analysis.

## Background

## Data
Data contains more than 65000 protein sequence with 137 features, including the target variable which indicates the amino acid is interface or not. The features include information about each amino acid such as protein ID from Uniplot, protein length, PSSM matrix scores and hydropathy index.

## Objective
This project aims to improve the accuracy of protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction using a combination of machine learning models. Since the dataset had more than a hundred of features, the main focus was feature selection and preprocessing with R to ensure data quality and efficiancy in modeling.

 ## Research Question
- How different/similar will the feature selection between biological  approach and Data Analysis methods be?
- Can we build a model to predict an interface amino acid in production by combining both methods?

## This project utilizes several R libraries to perform data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization:

- `dplyr`: Used for data manipulation and transformation.
- `faux`: Employed for generating simulated datasets (if applicable).
- `DataExplorer`: Utilized for automatic data exploration which speeds up the initial data understanding process.
- `caret`: Provides a suite of tools for creating predictive models and performing cross-validation.
- `randomForest`: Used to fit random forest models for classification or regression tasks.
- `ggplot2`: Applied for creating various aesthetic data visualizations.
- `corrplot`: Used for generating correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables.
- `MASS`: Employed for its statistical tools and data sets which are used in several data analysis techniques.
